# What is AML-S905X-CC (Le-Potato)
To some it may be referred to as a "knockoff pi", but to me it's a affordable mini computer that permits me to experiment with GPIO. While the documentation is currently as of 2023 just community posts, that did not stop me from being able to understand more indepth about GPIO, and it's incredible flexibility. They use a more "broader" but primative library named "gpiod" (available for C and python). The only real disadvantage (if following from a RaspberyPi Guide) is that they did change a lot of how the board's GPIO headers are capable of doing.

# Who is Freenove?
They appear to be a Amazon seller who specializes in selling "bulk" kits for any RaspberryPi product. They include adapters, chips (commersial cheap ones), and RaspberryPi products. They were my gateway for using GPIO but they insist on using RaspberryPi's instead of other boards.

# Can I use and learn from these scripts without "Freenove products" to begin understanding "Le-Potato"?
Why of course yes. These chips that the starter kit provided are nothing more than publically available ones. In each scirpt there should be a distinctions of what Pins I used, and what would be recognized on a regular Raspberrypi (not tested, just speculation).

# Why only Python
I am a college student at the time of writting. I only had time to experiment with python

Forgive for the quality of the video or sound. This was shot from a phone, but at the very least it does display exactly the script did. Moreover, it shows what that project I was assigned to do from "Freenove"
They are also a bit "unprofessional" in the sense they are not so much of a "walkthrough" but rather a poorly made "Proof of Concept"

The videos had a size of 1.2gb which github did not like and now permenantly hold my git lfs on hold until I DELETE this repo. So, until then. Here is the command I used to compress the original video files:
ffmpeg -i file.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 35 file_compress.mp4

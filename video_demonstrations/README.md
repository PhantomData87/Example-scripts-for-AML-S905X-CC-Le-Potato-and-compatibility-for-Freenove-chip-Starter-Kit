Forgive for the quality of the video or sound. This was shot from a phone, but at the very least it does display exactly the script did. Moreover, it shows what that project I was assigned to do from "Freenove"
They are also a bit "unprofessional" in the sense they are not so much of a "walkthrough" but rather a poorly made "Proof of Concept"
It appears github will hold hostage my 1.2gb files of video. Never knew that was a thing
